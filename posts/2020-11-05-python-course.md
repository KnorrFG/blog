Recenty I've been asked whether I could teach Python to a fellow PhD student
and said yes. My plan was not to invest too much time into this, and just
assemble a list of resources to read, and a few practice tasks. However, by now
two more people have asked whether they could join, so I decided to gather
everything in one place and this place is here.

I will update this post when I add new posts that belong to this course, and
  it will be notoriously incomplete for quite some time. This course is not a
  "self study" course. So if you are some innocent reader, that was not
  directed here by me, I'd actually not recommend trying to learn python using
  this class (unless you have someone else who can hold your hand).

The people I teach all have some programming exerience with Matlab or R, i.e.
they know what  functions, variables or a loops are, but they have no CS
background what so ever. They need Python to write psychological paradigms and
do data analysis, and this course is geared towards them.

# The "Curriculum"

1. The first thing I hand out to them is [this](/assets/python_tutorial.pdf)
   pdf. It was originally part of my 
   [PyParadigm paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00059/full),
   when I tried to publish it in response to a "Call for tutorial Papers" in
   some psychology journal, but it was rejected. It was co-authored by Johannes
   Petzold and Michael Marxen.

1. Write the "Number guessing game".

    *Description*: The program chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and
    then gets a number from the player (and it shouldn't crash if s/he enters
    something that is not a number). If the number is correct, the player wins,
    otherwise s/he's given a hint whether the guessed number was too low or too
    high and can go again. After 10 missed trials the player lost. 

    The important thing here mainly is to get them to use functions and not
    write everything as one big block of code.  Later, I might add a solution
    as well as the most common problems.

1. Write a Black Jack game.
  
    It gets a little more complex now. Additionally to the actual Black Jack
    game, they should also record subject reaction times and decisions.
    I'll have them read up on
    [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), and
    [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), as well as
    [NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple),
    and [Enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) and instruct them
    to use a NamedTuple of two enums to represet a Card, and that they should
    use json.dumps in combination with Path.write_text to store the recorded
    data.

    Once this is working I'll have them read 
    [PyParadigm's tutorial](https://pyparadigm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
    and then port the Black Jack from console to GUI using PyParadigm.
    This [set of card images](http://acbl.mybigcommerce.com/52-playing-cards/)
    can be used.

1. The next thing would then be to do some analysis with the data that is
   generated by the paradigm, but that hasn't happened so far, and Ill update
   this later. However, there is quite some things left they need to know about
   Python at this point, and I'll sprinkle them in between practical exercises. 
   So the next thing to read is:
    - [Mutable vs Immutable objects](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-towardsdatascience-com-python-basics-mutable-vs-immutable-objects-829a0cb1530a):
    - [(i)mutable arguments](https://riptutorial.com/python/example/28509/mutable-and-immutable-as-arguments)
    - [mutable default args](https://florimond.dev/blog/articles/2018/08/python-mutable-defaults-are-the-source-of-all-evil/)

   To do some analysis, they should also read introductory tutorials for
   [numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) 
   ([alternative, if no matlab
   experience](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/index.htm)) and 
   [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html).
   Last but not least, an environment is needed to do the analysis in. Most
   people would probably recomend jupyter. I wrote a post about this topic for
   this course: [An Introduction to Jupyter - and why I don't like
   it](/why_no_jupyter)
