Jupyter Notebooks are hugely popular.  In this post I'll give an introduction
into what they are, why I would actually not recommend using them, and what I
do instead.

# What is Jupyter?

Currently there are two important things: 

1. Jupyter Notebooks, which are a type of "document" which contains executable
   code, as well as outputs of that code like images, tables, or text and
   styled text via Markdown, which also supports mathematical equations.
2. Jupyter Lab, which is a browser based IDE.

You can think of a Jupyter notebook like of the ipython console. But instead of
typing your code into a terminal, you type it into a code cell in your browser.
If you execute it, the results are printed below it and you can then open a
new cell to execute further code and still, at any point in time, go back to
the above cells and rerun or edit that code easily. If your code creates a
plot, that plot will be part of the document too. Here is a screenshot of what
this looks like:

It has many more Features, like interactive sliders, and if you use Jupyter Lab
to edit them, it also supports other filetypes, and may look like this:

They are, all in all, pretty damn powerful and extremely popular among data
scientists and students. If you do want to use them I'd recommend to follow a
tutorial: [first Google hit for "jupyter tutorial"](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

# Why I don't like them

I don't want to hate on Jupyter, it's an impressive piece of software that is
  excellent in what it does; BUT, I just don't think it's a good Idea to do
  what it does. 

Jupyter's main selling point is to combine Code, its results, and text. And
there is no point in doing that, except for teaching. Actually for teaching,
Jupyter is awesome. However, the most common use case is data analysis. 
I've used Jupyter Notebooks excessively for nearly two years for the purpose of
data analysis and have frequently encountered the following problems:

## Crowded Notebooks

Usually, for me, I found that 70% - 90% of the visible area in a notebook was
covered with code, rather than with results. To get to a result, you'd have to
scroll a lot. Further more, because of the easy access to code that was typed
in earlier, I'd regularly go up, make some changes, rerun a cell, and then
continue in the bottom. This would lead to notebooks that will not be able to
execute from top to bottom because some cells would rely on something that was
changed away in a cell above it. Also, I would copy a lot of code between
notebooks, which is a terrible thing to do.

## Copied Notebooks

Sometimes I did an analysis in Jupyter, and at some point, I would want to run
that same analysis with a different dataset. What would I do? Obviously I'd
copy that notebook, exchange the path in the top, and run it again. (At this
point I'd probably realize, that it can't run from top to bottom without
crashing, so I'd have to spent quite some time on fixing the notebook).
This might happen again. And again. AND THEN you find a bug in that notebook,
and have to fix it in ALL of those pesky copies, `<sarcasm>`oh the pleasure â€¦
`</sarcasm>`

## Git incompatibility

People tend to have notebooks stored in git repositories, or at least I
used to. Sometimes git would see a notebook as changed when I just opened it,
and scrolled down without actually making changes. Also notebooks contain
images, these Will blow up your repository hugely. Also it's a very bad
practice to store data in git. Git is for source code.

## You have to edit Stuff in the Browser

Jupyter Lab runs in the browser, this means you have to edit your code in the
Browser. I don't like that. I have put a lot of effort into my .vimrc, and I
want to use it. I absolutely hate editing Code in notebooks. Yeah, sure, there
are plugins that give you some Vim functionality, but that's just additional
effort for a worse solution (compared to editing code with Vim)


# Conclusion

All of these Points can be countered. You can avoid crowded notebooks by having
some self discipline, putting most of your code into python modules that you
just call into from the notebook, and it's in your hand whether you check that
your notebook stays executable as a whole or not. If you do this, chances are
that bugs are in a Python module, and you don't need to edit copied notebooks.
You cannot get rid of all the problems that Jupyter notebooks produce within a
git repository, but you can solve some of them by deleting all of the outputs
before you commit. But if you do this, and also only put very little code into
them, because most of your code is in modules, then what is left of the
notebooks?  Also, this misses another points. Code that generate results, and
the results are not the same thing, and don't belong together (at least in my
oppinion).  Having a script that generates results based on some inputs, and
then rerun it, if you want to have an old analysis on new data is a much better
practice. Most people that care for your results won't care for your code at
all. This way you can also simply send them the results, instead of somehow
separating results and code beforehand, but most importantly: you can keep your
results out of your git repository. For me the biggest selling point of Jupyter
was always how easy it was to get persistent results. Before that I'd manually
write code to save a plot as image or a pandas table as csv (ok, that's just
one line, but I'm lazy and it annoys me. Additionally, I didn't have one file,
where I can also put text, but just mutliple files). And that's the main point:
laziness. In the long run, we will tend to take the easiest, most comfortable
route, and while it is possible to mitigate a lot of the problems I addressed,
it is not the easy thing to do, which means that most of us will, again and
again, end up with multiple versions of the same cluttered notebook in a git
repository that has a size of 5GB, while 20MB would easily suffice.

I wrote my [datasheet](https://datasheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
  that allows me to store output data of scripts, which tries to emulate the
  look of Jupyter notebooks without code, easily. For interactive prototyping I
  use simple plain old python files together with
  [vimteractive](https://github.com/williamjameshandley/vimteractive#usage)
  (and every other programming editor has a similar functionality).
  This basically fulfills all the needs of cell based editing that I have.  No
  one expects these scripts to run as a whole afterwards, and I can still keep
  them around in order to extract some of the prototyped code into tested
  modules later.
